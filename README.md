Snake Game recreates the classic childhood game where players control a growing snake, eating food while avoiding collisions. 
It features movement controls, food spawning, and collision detection.

The Snake game isn't just a coding project—it’s a connection to childhood memories, bringing back the joy of simple yet engaging gameplay. 
It makes learning to code feel more personal and meaningful.
